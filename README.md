# Volvo Cars (Global Online Digital) 
## Front-end coding test (React)

## Developer Notes
- I did my best to meet the requirements and the designs ( the 2 pngs given)
- I added a text field in the cars page where you can search by `bodyType`, `modelName` and `modelType`
- I implemented a responsive and animated carousel. And when on mobile, has touch gesture capabilities.
- I used the design system component library on the learn and shop page. Im perfectly ok with working with libraries, but I would say the documentation of this one could be improved. That's why I only used it in this pages.
- Didn't understood well what to do on the Learn and Shop page. I created the pages dynamically, based on the corresponding car ID, and used react router funcionalities. I understood this was a test to my React Router capabilities and didnt invest much time in the design. I also had short time on doing this test, so I focused more on the carousel.
